Configuration of Motion Detection Sensor ( v0.3+ Only )
-----------

It is recommended you have your camera feed setup and working in vera before you proceed to configure
the motion sensor.

VERA CONFIGURATION

- Got your camera you want to configure for motion sensor and click the edit button (wrench)

- Go to the Advance Tab

- Scroll until you see "EnableMotionSensor" and change the value to 1
	(0 = Disable Motion Sensor | 1 = Enable Montion Sensor)

- Close the settings and the Red Save button, this will reload vera and create the motion sensor

- Find your montion sensor "Devices" > "Sensor Tab" it defaults to the name of the Camera followed by "Motion Sensor"

- Click on Edit (wrench) > Settings Tab and get your device ID number (REMEMBER THIS). This is how we tell Blue Iris to trigger the sensor

- This is all you need to do in Vera the next step is to configure Alert trigger in Blue Iris for the Sensor in Vera

BLUE IRIS CONFIGURATION

- From your zip file you downloaded take the folder named "biveratools" and copy it to your C: drive

- So the path to this folder should be C:\biveratools and the there should be 2 files in that folder

- Open Blue Iris

- Right Click on the Camera that you want to configure to Trigger Vera for motion sensor

- Click "Camera Properties"

- Click the "Alerts" tab

- Click Run a program or execute a script and hit Configure

- Click the "..." button next to the File file and browse to the file C:\biveratools\blueiris2vera.bat

- In Parameters Box enter Your Vera IP address then a space followed by the numerical sensor id# from vera in the step where i said REMEMBER THIS

- That is it once you have entered all this you can hit the "Test" button in the bottom left hand corner of Blue Iris
and if you go into Vera and see that motion sensor it should then trigger red for 30 secs and then shut off.

- If everything works you can then OK and OK out of the camera properties settings

Configuration Options
-----------

Located under Device Settings > Advance Tab

Pan2Preset : ( 0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled) - This option converts your Left, Right, Up, Down to Presets.
Left = Preset 1, Up = Preset 2, Right = Preset 3, Down = Preset 4. This is useful if you have a fixed camera
and want to gain preset control on a mobile app that may not have presets (ie: iVera)

Zoom2Preset : ( 0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled) - This option converts your ZoomIn and ZoomOut to Presets.
ZoomIn = Preset 1, ZoomOut = Preset 2. If you have Pan2Preset enabled, ZoomIn = Preset 5, ZoomOut = Preset 6

ReverseHorizontal : ( 0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled) - Reverse the control of Left and Right. Pan2Preset & Zoom2Preset must be
set to 0 for this to work. I also recommend letting Blue Iris handle all the control configuration but just in case someone needs
it I added this option 

ReverseVertical : ( 0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled) - Reverse the control of Up and Down. Pan2Preset & Zoom2Preset must be
set to 0 for this to work. I also recommend letting Blue Iris handle all the control configuration but just in case someone needs
it I added this option
